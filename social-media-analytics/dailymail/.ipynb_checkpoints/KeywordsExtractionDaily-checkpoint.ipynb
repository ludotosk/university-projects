'' earlier this week , us national nuclear security administration chief jill hruby confirmed in a congressional testimony that her agency , along with the national security agency ( nsa ) , have installed sensors in ukraine to detect radiological activity and has already started training people in ukraine on how to respond in case of a nuclear blast .\",\n",
